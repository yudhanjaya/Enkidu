the winds of the south,
north, east, and west, the hurricane,

the tempest, the storm, and i was afraid ;
i could not endure. the land of uruk surrounded
gilgamesh ; all the people were gathered around him,
and his own dogs tore him to pieces.

rigidity and lightness. these could be projected by rocket

action and with cumulative acceleration till their speed was
almost half the speed of light.
surely this great and lovely creature must be alive,
must have been hundreds of miles above the ground,

and his breath is death.
he can recover only faint echoes and a vague
glamour. but even the most rigid of the artificial
elements was too weak to allow of lofty structures.

as time advanced, the internal heat of the sun
